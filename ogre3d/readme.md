set plugins.cfg folder to  location with ogre libs
PluginFolder=/usr/lib/aarch64-x86/OGRE or something like that on ubuntu i tried with 1.12 and it did not work on arm

I compiled with latest ogre on suse linux 15.5 and on raspberry pi os 5. put the ogre folder inside this folder build it then you should be ready to compile with it. make sure the system ones are uninstalled
